An XML Editor facilitates multiple operations to be made on the XML input file.
The user can browse to the location of the XML file he/she wants to make operations on it, then he/she can make different operations like:
*	Checking the XML consistency and detects and corrects the errors, showing a message to the user containing the number of errors if found.
*	Formatting (Prettifying) the XML.
*	Converting XML to JSON (Javascript Object Notation).
*	Minifying the XML file by removing spaces and newlines.
*	Compressing the data in the XML file to reduce its size.
*	Decompressing the data back into XML.
Then a new file is saved in the same path of the input file.
